## Todos

- Make it so that i can have something like `0.0.0.0 -> 0.0.0.10 : range_name` in the targets file that will scan everything in that range.
- Automatically get the scripts and put them in /opt/
- Add argument that lets the user state which scan types they want to run.
  - Current scan types are basic, discovery, udp or full tcp scans.
- Add more scan types.
- Improve performance with concurrency.
